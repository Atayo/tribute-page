       alt="maya angelou as a child">
      <div id="words">
      <p>On April 4, 1928, Marguerite Annie Johnson, known to the world as Maya Angelou, was born          in St. Louis, Missouri</p>
      <p>Due to her parents’ tumultuous marriage and subsequent divorce, she went to live with            her paternal grandmother in Stamps, Arkansas from an early age. Her older brother,                Bailey, gave Angelou her nickname “Maya”.</p>
      <p>Returning to her mother’s care briefly at the age of seven, she was raped by her                  mother’s boyfriend. He was later jailed and then killed when released from jail.</p>
      <p>Believing that her confession of the trauma had a hand in the man’s death, Angelou                became mute for 6 years. During her mutism and into her teens, she again lived with her          grandmother in Arkansas</p>
      <p>Maya Angelou’s interest in the written word and the English language was evident from an          early age. Throughout her childhood, she wrote essays, poetry, and kept a journal.</p>
      <p>Prior to the start of World War II, Angelou moved back in with her mother, who at this            time was living in Oakland, California. She attended school at Mission High School, and          took dance and drama courses at the California Labor School.</p>
      <p>Maya Angelou became the first African American woman to work as a streetcar conductor in          San Francisco. She was employed for a semester and then decided to return to school.</p>
      <p>In her last year of school, she became pregnant and gave birth to a son at the age of 16          soon after graduating from high school
      </p>
      <p>Married twice, firstly to a greek sailor named Tosh Angelos. Angelou’s second husband            was civil-rights activist Vusumzi Make. They moved together to Cairo, Egypt, in 1960 but          divorced soon after. Angelou decided to stay in Africa with her son,and relocated to              Ghana with other African American intellectuals as part of the Pan-Africanist                    movement</p>
      <p>Maya Angelou died on May 28, 2014. Several memorials were held in her honor including            ones at Wake Forest University and Glide Memorial Church in San Francisco. To honor her          legacy, the US Postal Service issued a stamp with her likeness on it in 2015.</p>

    <div id="words1">
    <p>When war broke out, Maya Angelou applied to join the Women’s Army Corps. However, her            application was rejected because of her involvement in the California Labor School, which        was said to have Communist ties. Determined to gain employment, despite only being 15            years old, she decided to apply for the position of street car conductor. Many men had            left their jobs to join the services, enabling women to fill them </p>
    <p>However, Maya Angelou was barred from applying at first because of her race. But she was          undeterred. Every day for three weeks, she tried to request a job application, but was            denied. Finally, the company relented and handed her an application. Because she was under        the legal working age, she wrote on her application that she was 19. She was accepted for        the position and became the first African American woman to work as a streetcar conductor        in San Francisco.</p>
    <p>Maya Angelou was employed for a semester and then decided to return to school. In her last        year of school, she became pregnant and gave birth to her son soon after graduating from          high school.</p>
    <p>Very soon after becoming a mother, Maya Angelou worked in several jobs as a waiter, cook          and nightclub singer. She recorded an album called calypso lady</p>
    <p>After graduation, she undertook many civil rights activities. She was northern coordinator        of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. This organization, which was created in          1957 by <a id="externalweb-link" 
       href="https://blackpast.org/aah/southern-christian-leadership-conference-1957"                    target="_blank">Martin Luther King</a> and originally known as the Southern Leadership            Conference, advocates for the rights of African Americans in the United States</p>
    <p>In the 1950s, African American writers in New York City formed the Harlem Writers Guild to        nurture and support the publication of Black authors. Maya Angelou was one of the Guild’s        early members. During these years, Angelou began writing her most famous work, I Know Why        the Caged Bird Sings, an autobiography of her life. The book was published in 1969, and          was nominated for the National Book Award the same year. Her autobiography has since been        translated into numerous languages, and it has sold over a million copies.</p>
    <p>Maya Angelou is also noted for her many and varied singing and dancing styles, including          her calypso music performances. She has written numerous poetry volumes, such as her first        book of poetry, entitled Just Give me a Drink of Water ‘fore I Diiie. She has also                recorded spoken albums of her poetry, including “On the Pulse of the Morning”, which she          won the Grammy for Best Spoken Album in 1994. The poem was originally written for and            delivered at President Bill Clinton’s inauguration in 1993. She also won a Grammy in 1996        and again in 2003 for her spoken albums of poetry.</p>
    <p>Maya Angelou also carried out a wide variety of activities on stage and screen as writer,        director, and producer. In 1972, she became the first African American woman to have her          screen play turned into a film with the production of “Georgia, Georgia”. The supporting          parts that she played in the films, “Look Away” in 1973 and “Roots” in 1977, garnered her        Tony nominations.</p>
    <p>She has been recognized by many universities both nationally and internationally for her          contributions to literature. In 1981, Wake Forest University offered Angelou the position        of the Reynolds Professorship of American Studies. She has also given many commencement          speeches and she has been awarded numerous honorary degrees.</p>
